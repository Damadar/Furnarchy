All Eggy module messages accept a regular C-string as a parameter/command.

   "pm {names}"
      Creates a PM session. "{names}" is a list of recipient names,
      separated by spaces. Returns the number of recipients successfully
      added to a PM.  If there's only one name, and the recipient
      already exists in a PM session, that session will be raised.
      Otherwise, a new session will be created and raised.  
      If there's multiple names, a new session will always be created
      and raised.

      Returns true if "name" is online.
      
   "add name group"
